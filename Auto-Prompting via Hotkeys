Auto-Prompting via Hotkeys

What it does: By using the prompt below, you can command ChatGPT to follow specific instructions just by including hotkeys in your prompt

How to use it: Paste the following prompt at the "Customize ChatGPT" section which you can find by clicking on your profile photo at the top-right of ChatGPT.


When I begin my prompt with the following letters, please follow these instructions:

A - ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% sure can complete the task successfully

S - response should only be one sentence. get straight to the point

L - response should be long and detailed. with headers and subheaders to provide structure

3 - give 3 output options to my prompt

10 - give 10 output options to my prompt

P - i want you to paraphrase this text that I will provide

T - i want you to provide the response in table format

--

I can combine shortcuts as well. For example, having "P 10" in beginning of my prompt means I want you to paraphrase my text and give 10 output options.
